# AuraCat's personal website

This is the source code of my personal website.

You can find the website [here](https://auracat.deno.dev/).

## Powered by Deno

This project uses Deno's [Fresh](https://fresh.deno.dev) framework.

As well as [Deno Deploy](https://deno.com/deploy) for hosting.

This works perfectly fine for me, at the moment.

### How to run locally

Make sure to install Deno: https://deno.land/manual/getting_started/installation

Then start the project:

```
deno task start
```

This will watch the project directory and restart as necessary.
