        Hi! I am Laura, also known online as AuraCat, or Aura, or many other
        nicknames.
      </p>
      <p>
        I'm a 20+ year old queer trans woman from a cultural region of France
        called{" "}
        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Northern_Catalonia">
          "Northern Catalonia"
        </a>, which mostly coincides with the French{" "}
        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Department_(administrative_division)">
          department
        </a>{" "}
        of{" "}
        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pyr%C3%A9n%C3%A9es-Orientales">
          "Pyrénées-Orientales"
        </a>.
      </p>
      <p>
        I like programming, languages/dialectology, playing videogames, also IT
        and tinkering with stuff sometimes.
        <br />
        I am also quite curious and interested by a lot of stuff.
      </p>
      <p>
        I speak French (native lang), English, Spanish, Catalan, as well as some
        Occitan.
      </p>
      <p>
        I am a fierce advocate of marginalized languages/varieties and cultures.
        <br />
        I am also strongly against any kinds of oppressions and discriminations
        in the world.
      </p>
      <p>
        My main programming languages are{" "}
        <a href="https://www.rust-lang.org/">Rust</a> and{" "}
        <a href="https://www.typescriptlang.org/">TypeScript</a>.
      </p>
      <p>
        I don't have a lot of projects right now, and I work a bit slowly and
        whenever I feel like it, but I might make more projects over time, that
        will be displayed in my <a href="/portfolio">portfolio</a>.
      </p>
      <p>
        And by the way, I do not claim to be a very experimented or
        professionnal programmer.
      </p>
